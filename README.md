Neverending Dream is a story driven RPG that questions the line between dream and reality. This is a personal project started in early
February 2019.

This is a work in progress that I will be updating ocasionally.
Please be respectful! Feel free to take a look at the code and learn from this. :D
If you would like to help, have suggestions/tips, or have any quesitons, just let me know.

Screenshots of RPG in progress will be added ocasionally. Check out the Wiki for more information.
