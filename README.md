<h2 align="center"> An RPG made in Python</h2>

Neverending Dream is a story driven RPG that questions the line between dream and reality. This is a personal project started in early
February 2019.

This is a work in progress that I will be updating ocasionally.
Please be respectful! Feel free to take a look at the code and learn from this. :D
If you would like to help, have suggestions/tips, or have any quesitons, just let me know.

I'll be learning as I go, so if there's a long time between updates, it probably means I got stuck on figuring out how to make something happen in pygame and am researching online for similar problems and solutions (usually Stack Overflow). I'm listing my next goals in the Wiki, so if you have any tips for me as to how to achieve those goals, I would be extremely grateful to you!

Screenshots of RPG in progress will be added ocasionally. Check out the Wiki for more information.
