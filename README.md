&emsp; Neverending Dream is a story driven RPG that questions the line between dream and reality. This is a personal project started in early
February 2019.

&emsp; This is a work in progress that I will be updating ocasionally.

Synopsis: <br>
&emsp;A boy cannot (or pretends not to) tell the difference between reality and dream. As he makes friends and is tasked with the quest to save the world, he must decide to relenquish a happy, but false dream, or brave a harsh and boring adult life.

&emsp; Screenshots of RPG in progress will be added ocasionally. Check out the Wiki for more information.

&emsp; I'll be learning as I go, so if there's a long time between updates, it probably means I got stuck on figuring out how to make something happen in pygame and am researching online for similar problems and solutions (usually Stack Overflow). I'm listing my next goals in the Wiki, so if you have any tips for me as to how to achieve those goals, I would be extremely grateful to you!
